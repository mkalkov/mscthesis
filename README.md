How to compile presentation sources on Windows
----------------------------------------------

1. Install Tex Live from [http://www.tug.org/texlive/](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). I've used the advanced installer with default settings and run it as an administrator.

1. Create a directory `%USERPROFILE%\texmf\tex\latex` and unzip `beamer-umbc.tar.gz` into it

1. Compile a PDF file

   * Open coverage_presentation.tex in TeXworks editor and compile it twice with pdflatex.

   * Navigate to the directory with presentation sources in cmd.exe or in cygwin and run pdflatex twice.
