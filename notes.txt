How to compile presentation sources on Windows

1. Install Tex Live from http://www.tug.org/texlive/ I've used the advanced installer with default settings and run it as an administrator.

2. Create a directory %USERPROFILE%\texmf\tex\latex and unzip beamer-umbc.tar.gz into it

3a. Open coverage_presentation.tex in TeXworks editor and compile it twice with pdflatex.

3b. Open the directory with presentation sources in cmd.exe or in cygwin and run pdflatex.exe twice.
